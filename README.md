## Introduction

Based on the assumption that a main factor stopping house owners from installing solar panels on their roofs is the lack of knowledge about the profitability, we created this web application. Its purpose is making it easier to overview the economic aspects of installing a solar panel system at a given location within Sweden. Hopefully it could lead to a higher share of renewable energy sources in our society.
